# /AITMA - Am I the Masshole?

As a New Yorker, I would jaywalk in Massachusetts (not Boston, though) but not NYC, but I still thought NYC streets were safer. Am I the Masshole? To determine whether my Massumption was supported, I compared car crash data between Massachusetts and New York.

### About the Data & Libraries

The dataset I used for this analysis is the car crashes dataset that comes from Python's Seaborn library. I utilized the Python libraries Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data exploration and visualization.

### Data Exploration & Analysis

I first checked for nulls in the dataset, before turning my attention to the Northeastern states, to begin comparing Massachusetts and New York, but to also place them in context with other states in the same region. From the get-go, starting with total number of fatal collisions per billion miles, Massachusetts had the fewest of all of them. From there, for every variable I looked at to determine which state was safer, Massachusetts performed better -- Massachusetts had fewer first-time offenders, and fewer cases of speeding, alcohol, and distracted drivers involved in car collisions. 

What makes Massachusetts comparatively safer than New York (and safest of all 50 states, at least during the time period of the dataset)? Further research is required because I initially thought Massachusetts may have higher insurance premiums than New York, which could serve as a deterrent for collisions, but New York's premiums are actually higher than Massachusetts'. Not only that, there was no correlation between fatal collisions per billion miles and insurance premiums.

### Conclusion

As it turns out, I was indeed the Masshole for assuming New York was safer than Massachusetts, though I don't think I'll be jaywalking again any time soon.
